            <h3>Raccoon Basics</h3>
            <p>
                The raccoon (/rəˈkuːn/ or US: /ræˈkuːn/, Procyon lotor), sometimes called the
                common raccoon to distinguish it from other species, is a medium-sized mammal native to North
                America.
                It is the largest of the procyonid family, having a body length of 40 to 70 cm (16 to 28 in), and a
                body
                weight of 5 to 26 kg (11 to 57 lb).

            <h3>Where did the term Raccoon Come From?</h3>
            <p>The word "raccoon" was adopted into English from the native Powhatan term meaning “animal that
                scratches
                with its hands”, as used in the Colony of Virginia. Its Latin name means “before-dog washer". It was
                recorded on John Smith's list of Powhatan words as aroughcun, and on that of William Strachey as
                arathkone. It has also been identified as a reflex of a Proto-Algonquian root ahrah-koon-em, meaning
                "the one who rubs, scrubs and scratches with its hands". The word is sometimes spelled as
                racoon.</p>

            <h3>Family Life</h3>
            <p>Though previously thought to be generally solitary, there is now evidence that raccoons engage in
                sex-specific social behavior. Related females often share a common area, while unrelated males live
                together in groups of up to four raccoons, in order to maintain their positions against foreign
                males
                during the mating season, and other potential invaders. Home range sizes vary anywhere from 7.4 acres to
                12,000 acres. After a
                gestation period of about 65 days, two to five young, known as "kits", are born in spring. The kits
                are
                subsequently raised by their mother until dispersal in late fall.</p>
